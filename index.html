      <h2 class="heading">About Me</h2>
      <p>As a kid, I was always intrigued with creating and building. I had to understand how everything worked. This has become a life-long passion to build what I could buy, despite the added cost. I have worked hard to turn my passion into a craft others can appreciate as much as I do. This site is about my journey as a craftsman, and a chance to showcase the projects I have created.</p>
