This repo is intended to be a place to practice front-end web development, and show off the projects I have built.

The responsive page requirement was met for converting the 2 column layout to a single column layout on the main page.

More than 3 CSS rules were also written to meet the CSS requirement. Comments were also added.

Custom written JavaScript was written to toggle the navigation menu, and create an image carousel on some of the supporting pages.
